# IsTweetViralClassifier

In the first part, system predicts whether or not a tweet will go viral by using a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier.

In the second part of this project, the power of Naive Bayes classifiers is tested by creating a system that predicts whether a tweet was sent from New York City, London, or Paris. 

System investigates how language is used differently in these three cities. The classifier automatically detect the difference between French and English, and learns local phrases and slang.

Ultimately the model predicts 65% of the tweets correctly.
